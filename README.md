# The Ultimate List of Everything!

`The Ultimate List of Everything!` is a sample project for the *Designing Applications for Kubernetes* course. Create your own fork of this project and follow along as we implement the [twelve-factor application design methodology](https://12factor.net/) in Kubernetes!


- Has an os-level dependency / command line call
- Uses a language-based dependency manager
- Takes in non-sensitive configuration via file or env var (ConfigMap)
- Takes in sensitive configuration via file or env var (Secret)
- Talks to a backing service via network
- backing service url / creds are hard coded or similar
- Web app (listens on a port, can do horiz scaling etc)
- Writes something to the file system (cache or something)
- Logs to a file
- Includes an admin process of some sort

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
